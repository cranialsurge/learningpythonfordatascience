    "## Sparse Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "A sparse matrix is a matrix that is comprised of mostly zero values. Sparse matrices are distinct\n",
    "from matrices with mostly non-zero values, which are referred to as dense matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix is sparse if many of its coe cients are zero. The interest in sparsity arises\n",
    "because its exploitation can lead to enormous computational savings and because\n",
    "many large matrix problems that occur in practice are sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sparsity of a matrix can be quantified with a score, which is the number of zero values\n",
    "in the matrix divided by the total number of elements in the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### sparsity = count of zero elements/total elements\n",
    "\n",
    "For example a matrix with 13 zero values out of a total of 18 values in the matrix will have a sparsity score of 0.722 or about 72%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space complexity \n",
    "Very large matrices require a lot of memory, and some very large matrices that we wish to work\n",
    "with are sparse. In practice, most large matrices are sparse | almost all entries are zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a very large matrix that is too large to be stored in memory is a link matrix\n",
    "that shows the links from one website to another. An example of a smaller sparse matrix might\n",
    "be a word or term occurrence matrix for words in one book against all known words in English.\n",
    "In both cases, the matrix contained is sparse with many more zero values than data values. The\n",
    "problem with representing these sparse matrices as dense matrices is that memory is required\n",
    "and must be allocated for each 32-bit or even 64-bit zero value in the matrix. This is clearly a\n",
    "waste of memory resources as those zero values do not contain any information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time complexity\n",
    "Assuming a very large sparse matrix can be  t into memory, we will want to perform operations\n",
    "on this matrix. Simply, if the matrix contains mostly zero-values, i.e. no data, then performing\n",
    "operations across this matrix may take a long time where the bulk of the computation performed\n",
    "will involve adding or multiplying zero values together.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem of increased time complexity of matrix operations that increases with the\n",
    "size of the matrix. This problem is compounded when we consider that even trivial machine\n",
    "learning methods may require many operations on each row, column, or even across the entire\n",
    "matrix, resulting in vastly longer execution times.\n"
